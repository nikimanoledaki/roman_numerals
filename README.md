# Roman Numerals

Roman Numerals is an exercise completed during Week 2 of the Makers Academy course. 

## Purpose
The focus of this exercise was to set up a project in Ruby that passed the required RSpec unit tests. This exercise was timed - it was completed in 15 minutes.

## Unit tests
The following test were created with RSpec:
1. It converts number into numeral
2. It raises error if input is not an integer
